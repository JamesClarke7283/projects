A collection of project ideas ranging in complexity with example implementations, these can be found on the git repository at: [github.com/enchant97/project-ideas](https://github.com/enchant97/project-ideas).

Once you have found a project idea you like, try to think about how you would implement it before looking at the example implementations.

> A good place for programming help (mainly Python) is my site: [enchantedcode.co.uk](https://enchantedcode.co.uk/).


## Complexity Levels
Descriptions for complexity levels and what kind of guidance you will get for the description and example implementations.

### 1 - Simple
- good starting point for beginners
- Requirements list
- Detailed step by step guide
- Verbose code comments

### 2 - Moderate
- Requirements list
- Sparse step by step guide
- General code comments

### 3 - Complex
- Requirements list
- Code comments on main algorithms
