# Project Ideas
A collection of project ideas ranging in difficulty with example implementations.

Once you have found a project idea you like, try to think about how you would implement it before looking at the example implementations.

A good place for programming help (mainly Python) is my site: [enchantedcode.co.uk](https://enchantedcode.co.uk/).

## Difficulty Levels
Descriptions for difficulty levels and what kind of guidance you will get for the description and example implementations.

### 1 - Guided

- Suitable for someone starting out in programming
- Heavy use of code comments

### 2 - Easy
- Detailed task list
- Moderate use of code comments

### 3 - Average
- Semi-Detailed task list
- Code comments on main algorithms

### 4 - Hard
